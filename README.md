# PyCar
PyCar is a school project developed in Python 3 using a module called PyGame. It is a simple 2D-based car simulator, where your goal is to avoid crashing other vehicles. You gain score for every vehicle you don't crash, and the simulator speeds up gradually to make it harder to survive. Let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks and good luck!
